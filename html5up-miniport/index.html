				<h3>Making of My Portfolio</h3>
			</header>

			<p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Clean, Intuitive Navigation:</strong>
				The navigation of my portfolio has been designed with simplicity and clarity in mind. The main sections
				include "About Me," "Final Project," "Blog," and "Contact." This minimalistic approach ensures that
				visitors can easily access the core areas of interest without unnecessary complexity.
			</p>

			<p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Intentional Color Choices:</strong>
				The color scheme for the portfolio is deliberately kept basic, with a mixture of black, white, and gray.
				This choice aims to maintain high contrast for accessibility, catering to users with visual impairments.
				The simplicity of the color scheme also prevents distraction, allowing the focus to remain on valuable
				content and colorful images where applicable.
			</p>

			<p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Harmony Between Affordances and
					Signifiers:</strong>
				Throughout the portfolio, there is a harmonious balance between affordances and signifiers. Clear
				headings and structured content, combined with a straightforward navigation menu, contribute to a
				user-friendly experience. The design ensures that users can easily identify interactive elements and
				navigate through the content.
			</p>

			<p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Consideration to
					Accessibility:</strong>
				The color scheme, characterized by high contrast, is chosen with accessibility in mind. While alt text
				is not explicitly provided for images, the design decision to maintain a simple and distraction-free
				environment aligns with creating an accessible experience for users, especially those with visual
				impairments.
			</p>

			<p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Usability Elements for Digestible
					Content:</strong>
				Usability is enhanced through a lack of unnecessary complexity. Instead of traditional pagination,
				scroll shortcuts and reference tags are employed to streamline the user's journey through the content.
				This approach allows users to navigate through sections efficiently, contributing to a more seamless
				experience.
			</p>

			<p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Evidence of Evolution:</strong>
				The portfolio provides evidence of my evolution as a designer, especially evident in the "About Me"
				section and the detailed analyses of interfaces and color studies. The progression showcases not only my
				initial background but also the skills and knowledge I've gained over time.
			</p>

			<p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Proper Attribution of Others'
					Work:</strong>
				A commitment to ethical design practices is demonstrated through proper attribution in instances where
				external work is referenced or analyzed. This ensures that credit is given to the original creators,
				aligning with standards of integrity in the design community.
			</p>

			<p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Intentional Integration of My
					Values:</strong>
				The "About Me" section serves as a trunk test, providing a visual representation of my values as a
				designer. This intentional integration communicates my strengths, interests, and overall design
				philosophy to visitors, offering a quick insight into who I am as a designer.
			</p>

			<p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px; margin-top: 20px;">This brief overview outlines the key design
				decisions and considerations in the creation of my
				portfolio, ensuring it reflects my identity as a designer and provides an accessible, user-friendly
				experience.

						<h3><a href="#">Affordance and Signifiers I</a></h3>
						<p>#ApproximateAnalogy The concept of "Balancing Priorities" in design is analagous to a chef
							preparing a multi-course fancy meal. Just as a successful dish requires the chef to
							harmonize various ingredients, textures, and flavors, the design process necessitates the
							careful blending of different priorities and disciplines.

							This concept is vital in my career in project management and product development. It values
							the significance of collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams and balancing
							diverse perspectives, priorities, as well as constraints, in order to achieve a successful
							project. Just as a chef ensures each course complements the others, I must facilitate
							collaboration among team members to align usability, cost-effectiveness, reliability,
							manufacturability, and customer satisfaction while meeting business goals.

						<p>#WordJournal
							Word: Contrast
							I chose the word "Contrast" because it emphasizes the importance of creating visual
							differences
							among design elements. In my career, whether I'm crafting presentations, designing marketing
							materials, or developing user interfaces, creating contrast is crucial. It's a reminder that
							subtle differences can go unnoticed, and it's the distinct contrasts that capture attention
							and

						<p>#WordJournal
							Word: Harmony
							Color harmony is a fundamental concept highlighted in this reading. It's important for me to
							remember this concept in my career because it emphasizes the significance of creating
							visually pleasing and emotionally resonant color combinations. In various fields like
							graphic design, marketing, and even user experience design, understanding how colors work
							together to convey messages, evoke emotions, and establish brand identities is essential.

						<h3><a href="#">Colors Workshop</a></h3>
						<p>#WordJournal
							Word: Complementary
							Complementary color schemes are essential in the realm of color design. This concept is
							crucial for me to remember in my career because it highlights the power of using colors that
							are opposites on the color wheel to create striking visual effects. Complementary colors
							enhance each other's intensity and can be used to grab attention, convey emotions, and make
							designs more dynamic. Understanding and effectively applying complementary color
							relationships can significantly impact the effectiveness and aesthetics of my design work,

							Word: Clarity
							I chose the word "Clarity" to summarize the section discussing the importance of page names.
							This concept is crucial because it emphasizes the significance of clear and concise page
							names
							that match users' expectations as they click on a link. In my career, as I'm designing
							websites
							and creating user interfaces, maintaining clarity to communicate my work is vital. Users
							should

						<h3><a href="#">Color Study</a></h3>
						<br>
						<br>

						<img src="images/sc.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px;" /></a>
						<p>The original color scheme of the user interface is predominantly minimalist, employing a
							palette of white, gray, and black. It introduces a light red to yellow gradient for story
							rings, with subtle accents of blue and pink. This color scheme invokes a modern and
							sophisticated personality, allowing visual content to take center stage. The minimalist
							approach and calming touches of color aim to create an atmosphere where users feel
							comfortable, relaxed, and inspired while engaging with the platform. In the original design,
							we can observe a harmonious combination of colors. The predominantly neutral palette with
							accents of warm and cool tones creates a sense of balance and unity. This combination aligns
							with the analogous color scheme, utilizing colors next to each other on the color wheel. The
							soft gradient in the story rings introduces a subtle transition that adds visual interest
							without being disruptive.
						</p>
						<img src="images/sc1.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px;" /></a>
						<p>For the modified versions, I made deliberate changes to explore the impact of different color
							schemes. Here, I changed the color of the story rings and notifications to
							blue, a color associated with formality and trustworthiness. However, I retained the
							original minimal colors to assess the impact of this shift. This alteration aims to test how
							formality and trustworthiness affect the overall mood compared to the original design.</p>
						<img src="images/sc3.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px;" /></a>
						<p>In this variation, I swapped the dark and light colors, introducing a light purple
							background in place of the original white. Purple is a youthful color that emphasizes
							creativity, and its contrast with dark icons and logos adds a different dimension to the
							design. This variation examines the effects of changing the contrast and introducing a more
							creative, youthful atmosphere.</p>

						<img src="images/sc2.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px;" /></a>
						<p>In the final variation, I opted for a more extensive change by making the entire UI
							background blue, although in a lighter shade. The dark icons and logos remained black. This
							color scheme exudes a modern vibe that inspires creativity and showcases trust, yet it omits
							some of the formality of the darker blue. It's a departure from the original scheme but
							explores the effects of a cohesive, primarily monochromatic color palette.</p>

						<p>To reflect on the effectiveness of these variations, I considered multiple factors, such as
							the platform's target audience and its purpose. The original design provides a harmonious
							and visually pleasing experience. However, the variations introduce new dimensions. The
							first variation emphasizes trustworthiness, which could be appealing for formal or corporate
							platforms. The second variation, with its youthful and creative purple background, might be
							more fitting for a platform targeting a younger, artistic audience. The third variation,
							with an entirely blue UI, imparts a more modern and creative vibe. I find the final version
							the most effective to serve the platform’s purpose, because Instagram promotes creativity
							and aims to remain a trustworthy platform that protects users’ privacy and showcases their
							talents.</p>

						<h3><a href="#">#Tutorial: Creating Color Swatch Components in Figma </a></h3>
						<a href="#" class="image featured">
						</a>
						<p> <br>

							<img src="images/fig00.jpg" style="max-height: 240px; max-width: 260px; ;" />
							<br>
							In Figma, creating color swatch components is an essential step in building a design system.
							These components allow you to organize and document your color palette effectively, making
							it
							easy to maintain consistency throughout your design projects. Here's how to create color
							swatch
							components step by step:
						</p>
						<br>
						<a href="#" class="image featured"></a>
						<p>Step 1: Open Your Figma Project

							Ensure you have your design project open in Figma, or create a new one if needed. This
							tutorial
							assumes you've already set up some colors that you want to organize into swatch components.
							<br>
							<img src="images/fig01.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px;" />
							<br>

							Step 2: Select the Colors You Want to Include

							In your Figma project, select the shapes, text, or elements that represent the colors you
							want
							to turn into swatch components. You can do this by clicking on each color individually while
							holding down the Shift key to select multiple colors.


						</p>
						<a href="#" class="image featured"></a>
						<p>Step 3: Create Components

							With your colors selected, right-click on one of them, and from the context menu, choose
							"Create
							Component." Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `K` (Windows)
							or
							`Cmd` + `Option` + `K` (Mac).
							<br>
							<img src="images/fig02.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px;" />
							<br>
							Step 4: Name Your Component

							A dialog box will appear for naming your component. Give it a descriptive name that
							represents
							the color, such as "Primary Blue" or "Accent Red." This name will help you identify the
							color
							easily in the future.
						</p>
						<a href="#" class="image featured"></a>
						<p>Step 5: Add the Component to a Frame

							After naming your component, you'll notice it in the Assets panel on the left side of the
							Figma
							interface. Click and drag the color swatch component into a frame or section dedicated to
							organizing your color palette. This frame will serve as your color palette reference.
							<br>
							<br>
							Step 6: Duplicate and Arrange Swatches

							To create additional swatches, duplicate the color swatch component you just created by
							right-clicking on it in the Assets panel and selecting "Duplicate." You can create as many
							swatches as you need for your color palette.

							Arrange the swatches within the frame to visualize your color palette effectively. You can
							use
							grid or alignment tools to maintain consistency.
							<br>
							<img src="images/fig04.png"
								style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px; position:relative;" />
							<br>
							Step 7: Edit and Update Swatches

							Whenever you need to update a color in your palette, double-click on the color swatch
							component
							in the Assets panel. Make your color adjustments, and these changes will automatically
							reflect
							wherever you've used that color in your design.
							<br>
							<br>
							Step 8: Apply Swatches to Your Designs

							To use the color swatch components in your designs, simply drag and drop them onto shapes or
							text elements. This ensures that your design remains consistent, and any updates to the
							color
							palette are applied globally.
							<br>
							<br>
							Step 9: Share Your Design System

							If you're working on a collaborative project, be sure to share your design system with your
							team
							by publishing the components and styles. This ensures everyone is using the same colors and
							maintains design consistency.
							<br>
							<br>
							By following these steps, you can easily create and manage color swatch components in Figma,
							helping you maintain a cohesive and organized color palette within your design system.

						<h3><a href="#">Mockups</a></h3>
						<p>#Freeform

							<br>
							<br>

							In the bustling realm of web design, there exists a seemingly small but mighty element known
							as
							a tagline. These succinct phrases, often found alongside a website's name, carry a profound
							significance. In a world of short attention spans, they serve as powerful messengers,
							offering a
							quick glimpse into what a website is all about. Whether it's Nike's iconic "Just Do It" or
							Apple's "Think Different," these taglines hold the magic of instant recognition, forging
							strong
							connections between users and brands.

							<br>
							<br>

							But taglines are not just about brevity; they are about conveying value. They whisper
							promises
							of benefits, answering the question, "What's in it for me?" A well-crafted tagline isn't
							merely
							a description; it's a badge of distinction. In a digital landscape teeming with competition,
							taglines become the banners that set websites apart, telling stories of uniqueness and
							purpose.

							<br>
							<br>

							But the true magic of taglines lies in their ability to build trust. A clear and relevant
							tagline reassures users that the website is professional, focused, and committed. It creates
							a
							bridge of credibility, inviting users to cross over into the world of the site. Memorable
							taglines aren't just words; they are poetic verses that linger in users' minds, calling for
							them
							to become loyal customers or regular users.

							<br>
							<br>

							In the end, taglines may be small in stature, but their significance is great. They are

						Constructive feedback refers to providing feedback that is aimed at
						helping individuals improve their work or behavior. It focuses on pointing out areas for
						improvement while offering guidance and support.

						<br>
						<br>

						Reinforcing Feedback:
						<br>
						<br>
						Reinforcing feedback is feedback that encourages individuals to continue
						positive behaviors. It acknowledges and highlights behaviors or actions that are beneficial and
						should be continued.

						<br>
						<br>

						Redirecting Feedback:
						<br>
						<br>
						Redirecting feedback is given when there is a need for individuals to
						change specific behaviors. It involves pointing out what needs to stop or be altered and
						suggesting an alternative course of action.

						<br>
						<br>

						Feedback Culture:
						<br>
						<br>
						Feedback culture refers to the environment within an organization or team
						where feedback is not only accepted but actively encouraged. It involves creating a space where
						open and honest feedback is valued and integrated into daily processes.

						<br>
						<br>
						Users can react and comment in real-time, providing immediate feedback on
						content, aligning with timely feedback.

						<br>
						<br>

						Weaknesses:

						<br>
						<br>

						Limited Reinforcing Feedback:
						<br>
						<br>
						While users can give positive feedback through likes, Facebook
						lacks features to actively encourage reinforcing behaviors beyond reactions.

						<br>
						<br>

						No Feedback Sandwich:
						<br>
						<br>
						The interface doesn't explicitly follow the feedback sandwich approach;
						it's up to users to structure their feedback effectively.

						<br>
						<br>

						No Feedback Culture Promotion:
						<br>
						<br>
						Facebook doesn't actively promote a culture of constructive
						feedback among users.

						<br>
						<br>

						Facebook's News Feed aligns with some feedback guidelines, like structured and timely feedback.
						However, it could be improved by encouraging reinforcing behaviors, promoting a feedback
						culture, and providing guidance for effective feedback.

						<h3><a href="#">Assignment: Homework: Finding Inspiration</a></h3>
						<p> The artwork I've chosen for analysis is "New York, Night," an oil painting created by the
							renowned American artist Georgia O'Keeffe in 1928-29. This masterpiece is a striking
							portrayal
							of New York City at night. In this blog post, we will delve into the history of this artwork
							and
							explore three critical areas of analysis: "abstraction," "visual composition," and
							"emotional
							resonance."
							<br>
							<img src="images/art.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px; position:relative;" />
							<br>
							<br>
							Abstraction: Georgia O'Keeffe is well-known for her abstract and highly stylized approach to
							art, and "New York, Night" is no exception. In this painting, O'Keeffe takes the
							recognizable
							skyline of New York City and simplifies it into bold, geometric forms. The skyscrapers are
							reduced to elongated, minimalist shapes, emphasizing their towering presence. This
							abstraction
							serves to distill the essence of the cityscape, allowing viewers to focus on its
							architectural
							grandeur while stripping away unnecessary details. O'Keeffe's abstract interpretation
							challenges
							viewers to see the city from a fresh perspective.
							<br>
							<br>
							Visual Composition: The composition of "New York, Night" is a masterpiece of balance and
							contrast. O'Keeffe's use of vertical lines for the skyscrapers and the incorporation of
							negative
							space between them create a sense of rhythm and harmony. The painting's tall, slender format
							further accentuates the verticality of the city's buildings. The contrast between the deep,
							dark
							blues and the radiant, golden-yellow highlights, down to the red light reflection over the
							bottom left buildings, evokes a vivid sense of the night sky illuminated by the city's
							lights.
							O'Keeffe's careful visual composition draws the viewer into the nocturnal ambiance of New
							York
							City.
							<br>
							<br>
							Emotional Resonance: "New York, Night" exudes a sense of quietude and contemplation, an
							emotional resonance that sets it apart from traditional cityscape paintings. O'Keeffe's
							portrayal of the city at night captures a tranquil, almost meditative atmosphere, in stark
							contrast to the city's usual bustling energy. The use of deep blues and subdued yellows
							imparts
							a sense of serenity, inviting viewers to reflect on the city's dual nature—its frenetic pace
							during the day and its quiet moments under the night sky. O'Keeffe's ability to evoke this
							emotional response through her abstract representation is a testament to her artistic
							prowess.
							<br>
							<br>
							Description of UI Sketch:
							<br>
							<img src="images/sketch.jpg"
								style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px; position:relative;" />
							<br>
							The UI sketch I've created is intended for a mobile web browser interface, similar in design
							to
							Google Chrome. The central theme of this mobile browser UI is inspired by Georgia O'Keeffe's
							"New York, Night" painting, which exudes the tranquility and beauty of a cityscape at night.
							I
							found that to inspire a sense of exploration within me hence I chose to sketch a browser UI.
							<br>
							<br>
							Device: Mobile Web Browser
							<br>
							Topic: General Web Browsing
							<br>
							<br>
							The UI features a dark blue and black background, reminiscent of the night sky. The most
							striking element is the background image of a cityscape with shining lights and geometrical
							shapes, which mirrors the essence of O'Keeffe's painting. The skyscrapers are simplified
							into
							bold, abstract forms, and the lights of the city create a visually captivating scene. The
							dark
							background not only pays homage to the night sky in the painting but also serves to enhance
							the
							visibility of web content and reduce eye strain during nighttime browsing.
							<br>
							<br>
							Through this process of creating the UI sketch inspired by "New York, Night," I've learned
							the
							power of translating the emotions and aesthetics of visual art into digital design.
							O'Keeffe's
							painting, with its abstraction and emotional resonance, served as a rich source of
							inspiration
							for creating a UI that captures the same sense of calm and contemplation in a digital
							context.
							It highlights the idea that art can influence and enrich various aspects of our lives,
							including
							technology and UI design, by infusing them with deeper meaning and aesthetics.

						<h3><a href="#">UIUN Summit: Exploring Inclusivity in UI Design
							</a></h3>
						<p>

							<br>
							<br>
						<h4>Introduction:</h4>
						The UIUN Summit was not your typical class exercise but a transformative Accessibility
						Workshop intended to stimulate young designers' thinking about UI accessibility from a new
						perspective. It functioned as a mock United Nations of UI Accessibility, where each team
						represented a specific population and proposed necessary changes for the Sarpy County
						election commission site's mail-in ballot interface.

						<h4>Highlights of My Population:</h4>
						My partner and I represented "Children Under 13," a unique and vibrant group. We explored
						how this age group experiences the world, emphasizing their critical stage of cognitive and
						motor skill development, limited reading abilities, and strong visual comprehension. The
						needs of children under 13 included simplicity, flexibility, visually appealing and
						interactive elements, and minimal text content with clear instructions. Our original
						recommendations were geared toward these needs.

						<br>
						<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/category/kids/400x400" height="400" width="400" />
						<br>


						<h4>The Negotiations:</h4>
						The negotiations during the summit were surprisingly effective and understanding. Teams were
						open to listening and collaborating. It was a collective effort to find common ground and
						create a comprehensive set of requirements that could meet the needs of multiple
						populations.

						<h4>What I Fought For:</h4>
						I advocated for inclusivity. We aimed to ensure that our recommendations weren't exclusive
						to just children under 13 but could benefit other populations as well. For example, we
						pushed for clear and inclusive icons, autocorrect features, and visually appealing
						interfaces, which could also aid non-native speakers and individuals with intellectual
						disabilities.

						<h4>Changing Requirements:</h4>
						Our requirements evolved significantly during the negotiations. We joined forces with other
						groups to add more enhancement features that were inclusive of multiple populations. It was
						enlightening to see how collaborative efforts could lead to more comprehensive solutions.


						<br>
						<br>
						<h4> Unlikely Allies:</h4>
						Our unlikely allies turned out to be the group representing non-native speakers (ESL). We
						resonated with each other's ideas, particularly regarding the importance of clear, inclusive
						icons and intuitive design. We shared the common goal of making the interface understandable
						to a broader audience. Conversely, the group representing Gen Z was the hardest to convince.
						They prioritized speed over interactive feedback, which was different from our focus on
						child-friendly and interactive elements.

						<h4>Prioritizing Needs:</h4>
						Prioritizing the needs of different user populations during the UIUN Summit was a
						challenging but necessary task. We had to find a balance between various requirements. For
						instance, we emphasized clarity and simplicity in design for some populations, focusing on
						making the interface user-friendly and straightforward. On the other hand, for children
						under 13, our priority was on gamification and limited text content, aiming to engage them
						with interactive elements and child-friendly visuals.

						This experience taught us the importance of compromise and the significance of finding a
						middle ground to meet the diverse needs of the user groups.

						<br>
						<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/category/diverse/400x400" height="400" width="400" />
						<br>
						<h4>Greatest Takeaways:</h4>

						The UIUN Summit was a unique experience that provided valuable insights into the
						complexities of UI accessibility. It emphasized the importance of collaboration and
						inclusivity in design, showcasing how designing with a specific population in mind can have
						far-reaching benefits. It also revealed that the strategies for UI accessibility are not
						exclusive to one group; they can be applied to benefit a wide range of users. These lessons
						will undoubtedly be applied to other topics and projects, ensuring that accessibility
						remains a central focus in my future endeavors.

						<h3><a href="#">Design Evolution Narrative</a></h3>
						<h4>Role in the Project:</h4>
						<p>
							Collaborating closely with my partner, we initiated the project by envisioning a package
							tracking solution tailored for creative professionals such as graphic designers. As the
							primary designer, my focus centered on refining the visual aesthetics and ensuring a
							seamless user experience. We also divided our user interviews to get unique feedback from
							different perspectives. We believed this would make our design richer due to the
							multi-angled view points that would contribute to diverse design ideas. My partner’s
							interviews and personal experience of living in an apartment, in which deliveries are more
							often delivered to the wrong tenant, were mostly focussed on the purpose of our application
							and the motivation behind its initiation to improve lives by providing a solution. Since I
							dealt with most of the mockup designs, I aimed to address the needs of my interviewees by
							incorporating solutions within my design, which encompassed the issues faced by my partner's
							interviews as we thoroughly communicated.
						</p>

						<h4>Inspiration and Target Audience:</h4>
						<p>
							Our inspiration was drawn from crafted user scenarios, exemplified by Emma, the graphic
							designer, and Michael, the stay-at-home parent. Their challenges with managing multiple
							deliveries resonated with us, sparking the idea to create an app that caters to the specific
							needs of busy individuals. Personally invested in the project, I saw the potential to
							streamline the lives of creative professionals through thoughtful design. Understanding
							Emma's need for efficiency and Michael's desire for simplicity, we integrated two key
							features into our app: real-time delivery status updates and a simple UI that consolidates
							all deliveries in one place.

							Our target audience, comprising graphic designers and stay-at-home parents, faces the common
							challenge of multitasking and staying organized. The objective was to provide a
							user-friendly package tracking app, alleviating stress, enhancing efficiency, and bringing
							ease to their daily routines. Inspired by Emma's desire to track the exact location of her
							art supplies in real-time, we implemented a feature that provides instant updates on the
							status of each delivery. This real-time tracking capability ensures that users like Emma can
							stay informed, even in the midst of a busy schedule, allowing them to plan their activities
							around the expected delivery time. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from Michael's struggle
							to keep track of multiple delivery schedules, we crafted a user interface that simplifies
							the tracking process. All deliveries, regardless of the vendor, are displayed in one place
							with clear and concise information. This user-friendly design ensures that individuals like
							Michael can easily manage their household responsibilities while staying on top of their
							online orders.
						</p>

						<h4>Target Device Type:</h4>
						<p>
							Initially conceptualized as a web application, we transitioned to a mobile app during our
							design process with Figma. Recognizing the on-the-go nature of our target users, a mobile
							app proved more accessible and convenient, facilitating tracking wherever our users are.
							Considering Emma's busy studio environment and Michael's juggling act as a stay-at-home
							parent, the app facilitates effortless planning. Users can quickly check the delivery status
							on the mobile app during breaks or while multitasking, empowering them to make informed
							decisions about their daily activities in a heartbeat! </p>

						<h4>Story-Inspired Design:</h4>
						<p>
							The narrative of Emma checking her art supply deliveries during a hectic workday and Michael
							managing deliveries amidst family activities guided our design choices. This
							narrative-driven approach influenced the creation of a streamlined mobile friendly
							navigation bar, a straightforward orders listing page, and real-time tracking updates for
							effective planning.
						</p>

						<h4>Early Sketches and Figma Mockup:</h4>
						<p>
							Our journey began with early sketches envisioning key components. Initially planned for a
							web platform (as previously mentioned), we later adapted our design to the mobile app format
							using Figma, which allowed for a more accessible and user-friendly experience. The Figma
							mockup encapsulated the flow and visual elements we envisioned with the values of a clear,
							intuitive UI and an efficient design where everything is organized in a user-centric manner.

						<img src="images/mk2.png" style="max-height: 300px; max-width: 600px;" />

						<h4>Design System Choices:</h4>
						<p>
							Carefully selecting a color palette balancing creativity with clarity, we aimed for rounded
							corners on buttons and inputs to convey a modern and approachable feel. The minimalist
							design ensured a clean and focused user interface, catering to the mobile app format. We
							wanted to esure intuitiveness and clarity, hence we aimed for the home page to contain all
							the incoming orders. We also wanted the design to be efficient for the user, hence we
							provided navigation icons where the user can access the main pages like, account info,
							settings, and home without a hassle. We chose the color dark blue as it motivates the
							feeling of trust and formality, and we paired it with high contrast colors like white and
							light gray to be inclusive of all users that may potentially have visual impairments. We
							ensured our buttons were large enough for users suffering from hand tremors or Parkinson’s
							like conditions. We also chose universally assumed icons for any users who may have trouble
							reading labels. We avoided using other bright colors like red to not cause an overflow or
							bleed of different color schemes, which may cause discomfort to the user’s vision.
						</p>

						<h4>Feedback and Changes:</h4>
						<p>
							Feedback from the colleague assessment prompted the addition of a branded logo, consistent
							icon alignment, and addressing of issues with the tracking number input frame not appearing
							on the Figma prototype. These refinements enhanced the overall user experience and design
							consistency. I Resized and repositioned the menu icons consisting of the settings, account
							info, and logout buttons so that they remain visually clear for all types of users, whether
							they have special visual impairment needs, color blindness, language barriers, or literacy
							problems. I also added a home icon that serves to return the user to the main page of
							orders, when they are deep into the settings pages. We really wanted our design to fulfill
							the values of clarity and efficiency for a diverse user base, hence we enhanced our
							accessibility with these changes. This would be much more efficient for users to navigate
							the different pages rather than having to press the back barrow multiple times to reach the
							main orders page. Regarding the tracking input, it was as simple as locking the frame in
							place on the Figma prototype. Our logo of choice is a squiggle with two location pins
							symbolizing the route followed by the delivery personnel!

						</p>

						<h4>User Testing and Feedback:</h4>
						<p>
							Conducting user testing involved the input of various perspectives of diverse backgrounds,
							including graphic designers, parents, and tech-savvy students at UNL. We envisioned these
							interactions, noting confusion points, and collected valuable feedback from these scenarios.
							We wanted to ensure our design was inclusive of all populations, and valuable to as many
							users as it can be. Our user testers were composed of other peers in University and we took
							feedback from about 4-5 different students, a graphic designer, and a college professor. For
							each user, our debrief presented our motivation to provide a clearly intuitive and efficient
							solution, referencing our design values, for delivery tracking. The task for each user was
							to login, view the main page, view a specific order, navigate to customer care, followed by
							the accessing settings page then returning home to the main orders. User feedback
							prioritized issues such as text visibility, icon intuitiveness, and theme clarity.
							Adjustments included refining text color for high contrast visibility to all users, adding
							intuitive labeling to icons for clarity, adding a home button in the settings page, fixing
							confusing prototype glitches like the non-appearing tracking input, and optimizing the theme
							colors/contrast for better visibility.</p>

						<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
						<p>
							Reflecting back on our previously referenced values, we’re proud to see our design align
							with the values of efficiency and clarity, exemplified through streamlined interfaces,
							simplified labels, and enhanced visibility. This of course wasn't achieved right away, as
							can be seen in our initial mockups. However, our commitment throughout the design process to
							fulfill our values ensured a design that resonates with the efficiency and clarity valued by
							our diverse user base!

						<h3><a href="#">Reading: Design Interviews</a></h3>

						<p>UX design interview preparation can be likened to creating a blueprint for a building
							construction project. Just as architects meticulously plan every detail before construction
							begins, interviewees in UX design must strategically prepare for potential questions,
							selecting specific examples like materials in a blueprint. The process involves translating
							this preparation into effective communication during the interview, showcasing
							problem-solving skills and design thinking. Understanding this analogy is crucial for career
							success, emphasizing the importance of strategic planning, effective communication, and the
							ability to anticipate and address challenges in the dynamic field of UX design.</p>
