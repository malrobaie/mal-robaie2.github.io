							Word: Sequencing
							I chose "Sequencing" because this section highlights the importance of breaking down actions
							into a sequence of stages. This concept is vital for my career in user experience design as
							it reminds me to design with a clear understanding of how users move through different
							stages when interacting with a product. Effective sequencing helps create intuitive designs,

							preparing a multi-course fancy meal. Just as a successful dish requires the chef to
							harmonize various ingredients, textures, and flavors, the design process necessitates the
							careful blending of different priorities and disciplines.

							This concept is vital in my career in project management and product development. It values
							the significance of collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams and balancing
							diverse perspectives, priorities, as well as constraints, in order to achieve a successful
							project. Just as a chef ensures each course complements the others, I must facilitate
							collaboration among team members to align usability, cost-effectiveness, reliability,
							manufacturability, and customer satisfaction while meeting business goals.

							web
							development and UI/UX careers, highlighting the need for intuitive, engaging websites.
							Hence, as
							a software engineer involved in designing front-end applications, this concept is vital for
							my

							Word: Contrast
							I chose the word "Contrast" because it emphasizes the importance of creating visual
							differences
							among design elements. In my career, whether I'm crafting presentations, designing marketing
							materials, or developing user interfaces, creating contrast is crucial. It's a reminder that
							subtle differences can go unnoticed, and it's the distinct contrasts that capture attention
							and
							guide the viewer's focus. By using contrast effectively, I can ensure that key information
							stands out, making my work more engaging, memorable, and impactful. This concept serves as a
							constant reminder to avoid uniformity and to leverage contrast as a powerful tool in my
							career
							as a UI/UX designer.

							remember this concept in my career because it emphasizes the significance of creating
							visually pleasing and emotionally resonant color combinations. In various fields like
							graphic design, marketing, and even user experience design, understanding how colors work
							together to convey messages, evoke emotions, and establish brand identities is essential.

							Word: Complementary
							Complementary color schemes are essential in the realm of color design. This concept is
							crucial for me to remember in my career because it highlights the power of using colors that
							are opposites on the color wheel to create striking visual effects. Complementary colors
							enhance each other's intensity and can be used to grab attention, convey emotions, and make
							designs more dynamic. Understanding and effectively applying complementary color

					<p>The color scheme is predominantly minimalist in white, gray, and black and a light red to yellow
						gradient for story rings, with subtle accents of blue and pink. This scheme conveys a modern and
						sophisticated personality, allowing visual content to take center stage. The touches of color
						are minimalists and calming, aiming to make users feel comfortable, relaxed, and inspired while
						engaging with the platform.
					</p>
					<img src="images/sc1.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px;" /></a>
					<p>I changed the story rings and the notification color to blue, which is a color that typically
						shows formality and trustworthiness. I kept the minimal colors the same to see how the minimal
						look compares to the next few designs
					</p>
					<img src="images/sc3.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px;" /></a>
					<p>Here, I swapped the dark and light colors to see the effect of changing the contrast. I used a
						light purple instead of the white background because it's a youthful color that emphasizes
						creativity and it's just dark enough to replace the original white.
					</p>

					<img src="images/sc2.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px;" /></a>
					<p>Here I took the trustworthy blue to a different level. I decided to make the entire UI background
						blue, and I chose a lighter shade to still complement the other dark icons and logos on the page
						which I kept black. This color combo lets off a modern vibe that inspires creativity and
						showcases trust while omitting some of the formality of a darker blue.

					<h3><a href="#">#Tutorial: Creating Color Swatch Components in Figma </a></h3>
					<a href="#" class="image featured">
					</a>
					<p> <br>

						<img src="images/fig00.jpg" style="max-height: 240px; max-width: 260px; ;" />
						<br>
						In Figma, creating color swatch components is an essential step in building a design system.
						These components allow you to organize and document your color palette effectively, making it
						easy to maintain consistency throughout your design projects. Here's how to create color swatch
						components step by step:
					</p>
					<br>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"></a>
					<p>Step 1: Open Your Figma Project

						Ensure you have your design project open in Figma, or create a new one if needed. This tutorial
						assumes you've already set up some colors that you want to organize into swatch components.
						<br>
						<img src="images/fig01.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px;" />
						<br>

						Step 2: Select the Colors You Want to Include

						In your Figma project, select the shapes, text, or elements that represent the colors you want
						to turn into swatch components. You can do this by clicking on each color individually while
						holding down the Shift key to select multiple colors.


					</p>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"></a>
					<p>Step 3: Create Components

						With your colors selected, right-click on one of them, and from the context menu, choose "Create
						Component." Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `K` (Windows) or
						`Cmd` + `Option` + `K` (Mac).
						<br>
						<img src="images/fig02.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px;" />
						<br>
						Step 4: Name Your Component

						A dialog box will appear for naming your component. Give it a descriptive name that represents
						the color, such as "Primary Blue" or "Accent Red." This name will help you identify the color
						easily in the future.
					</p>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"></a>
					<p>Step 5: Add the Component to a Frame

						After naming your component, you'll notice it in the Assets panel on the left side of the Figma
						interface. Click and drag the color swatch component into a frame or section dedicated to
						organizing your color palette. This frame will serve as your color palette reference.
						<br>
						<br>
						Step 6: Duplicate and Arrange Swatches

						To create additional swatches, duplicate the color swatch component you just created by
						right-clicking on it in the Assets panel and selecting "Duplicate." You can create as many
						swatches as you need for your color palette.

						Arrange the swatches within the frame to visualize your color palette effectively. You can use
						grid or alignment tools to maintain consistency.
						<br>
						<img src="images/fig04.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px; position:relative;" />
						<br>
						Step 7: Edit and Update Swatches

						Whenever you need to update a color in your palette, double-click on the color swatch component
						in the Assets panel. Make your color adjustments, and these changes will automatically reflect
						wherever you've used that color in your design.
						<br>
						<br>
						Step 8: Apply Swatches to Your Designs

						To use the color swatch components in your designs, simply drag and drop them onto shapes or
						text elements. This ensures that your design remains consistent, and any updates to the color
						palette are applied globally.
						<br>
						<br>
						Step 9: Share Your Design System

						If you're working on a collaborative project, be sure to share your design system with your team
						by publishing the components and styles. This ensures everyone is using the same colors and
						maintains design consistency.
						<br>
						<br>
						By following these steps, you can easily create and manage color swatch components in Figma,
						helping you maintain a cohesive and organized color palette within your design system.

					<h3><a href="#">Mockups</a></h3>
					<p>#Freeform

						<br>
						<br>

						In the bustling realm of web design, there exists a seemingly small but mighty element known as
						a tagline. These succinct phrases, often found alongside a website's name, carry a profound
						significance. In a world of short attention spans, they serve as powerful messengers, offering a
						quick glimpse into what a website is all about. Whether it's Nike's iconic "Just Do It" or
						Apple's "Think Different," these taglines hold the magic of instant recognition, forging strong
						connections between users and brands.

						<br>
						<br>

						But taglines are not just about brevity; they are about conveying value. They whisper promises
						of benefits, answering the question, "What's in it for me?" A well-crafted tagline isn't merely
						a description; it's a badge of distinction. In a digital landscape teeming with competition,
						taglines become the banners that set websites apart, telling stories of uniqueness and purpose.

						<br>
						<br>

						But the true magic of taglines lies in their ability to build trust. A clear and relevant
						tagline reassures users that the website is professional, focused, and committed. It creates a
						bridge of credibility, inviting users to cross over into the world of the site. Memorable
						taglines aren't just words; they are poetic verses that linger in users' minds, calling for them
						to become loyal customers or regular users.

						<br>
						<br>

						In the end, taglines may be small in stature, but their significance is great. They are
						storytellers, guides, and brand ambassadors, adding depth and meaning to the digital landscape.
						In the world of web design, where every detail matters, taglines stand tall as the ambassadors
						of effective communication and brand representation.

					<h3><a href="#">Feedback workshop</a></h3>
					<p>#DirectedAnalysis
						<br>
						<br>
					<h4> Topics Mentioned in the Reading:</h4>
					<br>

					Constructive Feedback:
					<br>
					<br>
					Constructive feedback refers to providing feedback that is aimed at
					helping individuals improve their work or behavior. It focuses on pointing out areas for
					improvement while offering guidance and support.

					<br>
					<br>

					Reinforcing Feedback:
					<br>
					<br>
					Reinforcing feedback is feedback that encourages individuals to continue
					positive behaviors. It acknowledges and highlights behaviors or actions that are beneficial and
					should be continued.

					<br>
					<br>

					Redirecting Feedback:
					<br>
					<br>
					Redirecting feedback is given when there is a need for individuals to
					change specific behaviors. It involves pointing out what needs to stop or be altered and
					suggesting an alternative course of action.

					<br>
					<br>

					Feedback Culture:
					<br>
					<br>
					Feedback culture refers to the environment within an organization or team
					where feedback is not only accepted but actively encouraged. It involves creating a space where
					open and honest feedback is valued and integrated into daily processes.

					<br>
					<br>

					Interface:
					<br>
					<br>
					Facebook News Feed:
					<br>
					<br>
					<img src="images/fb.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px;" /></a>

					<br>
					<br>

					<h4> Analysis:
					</h4>
					<br>
					<br>

					Strengths:

					<br>
					<br>

					Structured Feedback:
					<br>
					<br>
					Facebook offers structured feedback through reactions (like, love, etc.)
					and comments, adhering to the guideline of highlighting real examples in feedback.

					<br>
					<br>

					Timely Feedback:
					<br>
					<br>
					Users can react and comment in real-time, providing immediate feedback on
					content, aligning with timely feedback.

					<br>
					<br>

					Weaknesses:

					<br>
					<br>

					Limited Reinforcing Feedback:
					<br>
					<br>
					While users can give positive feedback through likes, Facebook
					lacks features to actively encourage reinforcing behaviors beyond reactions.

					<br>
					<br>

					No Feedback Sandwich:
					<br>
					<br>
					The interface doesn't explicitly follow the feedback sandwich approach;
					it's up to users to structure their feedback effectively.

					<br>
					<br>

					No Feedback Culture Promotion:
					<br>
					<br>
					Facebook doesn't actively promote a culture of constructive
					feedback among users.

					<br>
					<br>

					Facebook's News Feed aligns with some feedback guidelines, like structured and timely feedback.
					However, it could be improved by encouraging reinforcing behaviors, promoting a feedback
					culture, and providing guidance for effective feedback.

					<h3><a href="#">Assignment: Homework: Finding Inspiration</a></h3>
					<p> The artwork I've chosen for analysis is "New York, Night," an oil painting created by the
						renowned American artist Georgia O'Keeffe in 1928-29. This masterpiece is a striking portrayal
						of New York City at night. In this blog post, we will delve into the history of this artwork and
						explore three critical areas of analysis: "abstraction," "visual composition," and "emotional
						resonance."
						<br>
						<img src="images/art.png" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px; position:relative;" />
						<br>
						<br>
						Abstraction: Georgia O'Keeffe is well-known for her abstract and highly stylized approach to
						art, and "New York, Night" is no exception. In this painting, O'Keeffe takes the recognizable
						skyline of New York City and simplifies it into bold, geometric forms. The skyscrapers are
						reduced to elongated, minimalist shapes, emphasizing their towering presence. This abstraction
						serves to distill the essence of the cityscape, allowing viewers to focus on its architectural
						grandeur while stripping away unnecessary details. O'Keeffe's abstract interpretation challenges
						viewers to see the city from a fresh perspective.
						<br>
						<br>
						Visual Composition: The composition of "New York, Night" is a masterpiece of balance and
						contrast. O'Keeffe's use of vertical lines for the skyscrapers and the incorporation of negative
						space between them create a sense of rhythm and harmony. The painting's tall, slender format
						further accentuates the verticality of the city's buildings. The contrast between the deep, dark
						blues and the radiant, golden-yellow highlights, down to the red light reflection over the
						bottom left buildings, evokes a vivid sense of the night sky illuminated by the city's lights.
						O'Keeffe's careful visual composition draws the viewer into the nocturnal ambiance of New York
						City.
						<br>
						<br>
						Emotional Resonance: "New York, Night" exudes a sense of quietude and contemplation, an
						emotional resonance that sets it apart from traditional cityscape paintings. O'Keeffe's
						portrayal of the city at night captures a tranquil, almost meditative atmosphere, in stark
						contrast to the city's usual bustling energy. The use of deep blues and subdued yellows imparts
						a sense of serenity, inviting viewers to reflect on the city's dual nature—its frenetic pace
						during the day and its quiet moments under the night sky. O'Keeffe's ability to evoke this
						emotional response through her abstract representation is a testament to her artistic prowess.

						Description of UI Sketch:
						<br>
						<img src="images/sketch.jpg" style="max-height: 640px; max-width: 360px; position:relative;" />
						<br>
						The UI sketch I've created is intended for a mobile web browser interface, similar in design to
						Google Chrome. The central theme of this mobile browser UI is inspired by Georgia O'Keeffe's
						"New York, Night" painting, which exudes the tranquility and beauty of a cityscape at night. I
						found that to inspire a sense of exploration within me hence I chose to sketch a browser UI.
						<br>
						<br>
						Device: Mobile Web Browser
						<br>
						Topic: General Web Browsing
						<br>
						<br>
						The UI features a dark blue and black background, reminiscent of the night sky. The most
						striking element is the background image of a cityscape with shining lights and geometrical
						shapes, which mirrors the essence of O'Keeffe's painting. The skyscrapers are simplified into
						bold, abstract forms, and the lights of the city create a visually captivating scene. The dark
						background not only pays homage to the night sky in the painting but also serves to enhance the
						visibility of web content and reduce eye strain during nighttime browsing.
						<br>
						<br>
						Through this process of creating the UI sketch inspired by "New York, Night," I've learned the
						power of translating the emotions and aesthetics of visual art into digital design. O'Keeffe's
						painting, with its abstraction and emotional resonance, served as a rich source of inspiration
						for creating a UI that captures the same sense of calm and contemplation in a digital context.
						It highlights the idea that art can influence and enrich various aspects of our lives, including
						technology and UI design, by infusing them with deeper meaning and aesthetics.
